    Sprite URL access is a *host-platform* setting, not something the in-VM
    ``sprite-env`` CLI can change — the in-VM API socket only exposes
    services/checkpoints. Without this capability, an agent asked to "make the
    URL public" tends to thrash between unauthenticated commands. This
    capability wraps ``Sprite.update_url_settings`` (which already has the
    application's API token via ``SpritesSandboxClient``) so the model can
    flip visibility in one call.

    Going ``public`` is gated by ``allow_public`` (default ``False``). The
    application must explicitly opt in to expose that option to the agent;
