"""Sprites sandbox (https://sprites.dev) implementation.

Create a Sprites organization, set ``SPRITES_API_TOKEN``, and optionally
``SPRITES_API_URL`` (defaults to ``https://api.sprites.dev``).

This package provides a Sprites-backed sandbox client/session that delegates to
the ``sprites-py`` SDK. Exec runs over the multiplexed control-plane WebSocket
(``ControlConnection`` / ``OpConn``) directly so cancellation, timeout, and
streaming work cleanly with the agents-python event loop. Short, non-streaming
lifecycle calls (``create_sprite``, ``get_sprite``, ``delete_sprite``,
filesystem read/write) are wrapped in ``asyncio.to_thread`` because the
upstream SDK exposes them synchronously.

The integration is distributed separately from both ``sprites-py`` and
``openai-agents`` so each SDK can remain provider-agnostic.
